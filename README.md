# Deep Ensemble Machine Learning with Bayesian blending for Ground-Level Ozone Prediction

This repository contains the code for supporting the deep ensemble machine learning component of the paper titled **"Deep ensemble machine learning with Bayesian blending improved accuracy and precision of modeled ground-level ozone for region with sparse monitoring."**

The Bayesian blending component of the project can be found at [https://github.com/cardat/DatSci_modelling_BME_O3](https://github.com/cardat/DatSci_modelling_BME_O3)

## Overview

The project applies deep ensemble machine learning techniques, combined with Bayesian blending, to improve the accuracy and precision of ground-level ozone predictions in regions with sparse monitoring. This repository includes all the necessary code to replicate the models and analyses discussed in the paper.

Data inputs are available on request and with authorised agreements.

## Contents

- `R/`: Contains the R scripts used for model training, and evaluation.
- `run.R`: A master R script to run the pipeline

## Requirements
